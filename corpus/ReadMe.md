## For Bible Study & Margin Notes

> _16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life._

This is a repo of the KJV scriptures. This is for non-public use in bible study. Made with care using [Bible Gateway](http://biblegateway.com) one chapter at a time.

## Uses & Notes

I have found it useful and fun to study the bible in my code editor; using project search, file fuzzy search, and even a dash of ASCII art to jump around in translations, journaling, and adding margin-notes in line in an indexable way. 

Using a tool like [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) you can convert this into other formats as needed.

I use [sublimetext-markdown-preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview) to open text in the browser where it is easy to highlight a passage and have a screen reader read aloud (alt+esc on MacOS).

Each file ends with an end-of-file "eof" tag to indicate its end; it's an intentional marker I find useful to denote the end of the content of the book.
